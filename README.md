# A simple implementation of deterministic Turing machines in Java

This project defines an implementation of Turing machines in Java. After the specification of their
transition table, Turing machines can be executed and their configuration get printed on the screen,
until an acceptance state is reached (acceptance) or no transition can be executed further (rejection)
or non-termination.
